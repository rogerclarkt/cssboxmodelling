<h1>The CSS box model</h1>	
			
<p>Every element on a web page represents a box that can be styled by the browser, with reference to a stylesheet. So this includes block level elements (those that force a new line) such as paragraphs and headings but also inline elements such as spans and links.</p>

<p>The boxes representing elements on a web page cannot be seen unless you add visual styles such as a background colour or a visible border, however knowing that they exist and how to manipulate them is important.</p>
